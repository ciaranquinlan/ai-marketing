## Hero Section

### Headline Analysis
**Current:** "AI Agent Automation for SEO & Ecommerce"

**Strengths:**
- Clear service category (AI automation)
- Mentions specific verticals (SEO, Ecommerce)

**Opportunities:**
- "Agent Automation" may confuse non-technical visitors
- Missing the "for whom" — who is this for?
- No outcome or benefit stated

**Suggested Alternatives:**
1. "AI Automation That Ships. For Australian Businesses."
2. "Turn AI Hype Into Business Results. In Weeks, Not Months."
3. "Claude Code Experts. Practical AI Implementation."

### Value Proposition
The subheading should answer: What do you do? For whom? What's the outcome?

**Current state:** Partially addressed — SEO & Ecommerce mentioned but the "so what" is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Add a subheading like: "We implement Claude-powered automation that saves SMBs 20+ hours per week. No strategy decks — just working systems."

### CTA Strength
**Current:** "Start your 14-day free trial" (for what?)

**Issues:**
- "Free trial" implies a product, but IntelliAgent is a consultancy
- Mismatch between CTA and likely offering
- No credit card required is good, but trial of what?

**Recommendation:** 
- Primary CTA: "Book a Discovery Call" or "See How It Works"
- Secondary CTA: "View Case Studies"

## Trust Signals

### What's Present
- Professional design ✓
- Clear branding ✓

### What's Missing
❌ Client logos — Add 4-6 recognizable Australian brands  
❌ Testimonials — Need 2-3 quotes with names, titles, headshots  
❌ Case study highlights — "Saved X 30 hours/week" type stats  
❌ Certifications/partnerships — Anthropic partner? Any credentials?  
❌ Media mentions — Press logos, podcast appearances  
❌ Team/founder — Who's behind this? Human connection matters  

### Recommendations
1. Add a "Trusted by" logo bar below the hero (even if it's "Companies we've helped")
2. Include at least one testimonial on the homepage
3. Add founder photo + brief intro in "About" section
4. Display a key metric: "X automations shipped" or "Y hours saved for clients"

## Content Flow

### Current Structure
1. Hero (headline + CTA)
2. Features/benefits (assumed)
3. CTA footer

### Issues
- No clear narrative arc
- Missing "How it works" section
- No case study or proof section
- No FAQ addressing objections

### Recommended Flow
1. **Hero:** Clear value prop + CTA
2. **Trust bar:** Client logos
3. **Problem:** "AI is overwhelming. Most consultants just talk."
4. **Solution:** "We implement working AI in weeks."
5. **How it works:** 3-step process (Discovery → Build → Deploy)
6. **Proof:** Case study highlight or testimonials
7. **Services:** What we offer (cards/grid)
8. **FAQ:** Address objections
9. **CTA:** Book a call

---

## Conversion Blockers

### Identified Friction Points

1. **Unclear offering** — Is this a product or service? SaaS or consulting?
2. **No pricing signals** — Not even "Starting at" or "Custom quotes"
3. **Missing social proof** — No reason to believe the claims
4. **Generic CTA** — "Free trial" doesn't match consulting services
5. **No urgency** — Why should I act now vs. next month?
6. **Anonymous brand** — Who runs this? Can I trust them?

### Objection Handling
Common objections not addressed:
- "How much does it cost?"
- "How long does implementation take?"
- "What if it doesn't work?"
- "Who else have you worked with?"
- "What makes you different from [competitor]?"

## Top 5 Quick Wins

### 1. Fix the CTA mismatch (30 min)
Change "Start your 14-day free trial" to "Book a Free Consultation" or "Get Your AI Roadmap"

### 2. Add client logos (1 hour)
Even 3-4 logos dramatically increase trust. Use company names with permission.

### 3. Add one testimonial (30 min)
A single quote with photo, name, and company beats no social proof.

Add "for Australian businesses" and an outcome: "Save 20+ hours per week"

### 5. Add founder section (1 hour)
Brief intro, photo, LinkedIn link. "Founded by Ciarán Quinlan, former [background]"
