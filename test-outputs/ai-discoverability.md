## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Discoverability Score: 5/10**

- Limited authoritative content that AI models can reference
- Missing from major citation sources (Wikipedia, industry publications)
- Competitor brands have stronger AI visibility
- Quick wins available through content structure and schema
