```
🎯 I help Australian businesses turn AI hype into operational reality.

While most consultancies are running "AI strategy workshops," we're deploying Claude-powered automation that saves our clients 20+ hours per week.

Here's what I believe:
→ AI should ship, not just strategize
→ The best AI projects start small and scale fast
→ You don't need an AI team — you need the right partner

What we do at IntelliAgent:
• Claude Code implementation (Anthropic's most powerful AI toolkit)
• Custom AI agent development
• Workflow automation that actually saves time
• AI strategy tied to measurable ROI

Who we work with:
Australian SMBs (10-500 employees) who are tech-curious but time-poor. E-commerce, professional services, SaaS.

### Sample 1: Hot Take
```
Hot take: Most businesses should NOT hire a full-time AI team.

Here's why:

The AI landscape is changing too fast. The skills you need today will be different in 12 months.

What I've seen work better:
→ Start with a focused project (not a "transformation")
→ Partner with specialists who do this daily
→ Build internal capability gradually
→ Keep the team lean and adaptable

The companies winning with AI aren't the ones with the biggest AI teams.

They're the ones shipping small automations that compound.

Agree? Disagree? I'd love to hear your perspective 👇
```

### Sample 2: Case Study
```
Last month, we saved a Sydney e-commerce company 30 hours per week.

Here's exactly what we did:

The problem:
Their ops team was spending 6+ hours daily on manual order processing, inventory updates, and customer queries.

The solution:
We built 3 Claude-powered automations:
1. Order anomaly detection (flags issues before they become problems)
2. Inventory sync across 4 platforms
3. Smart customer response drafts

The result:
→ 30 hours/week back for the team
→ 90% fewer order errors
→ Customer response time down from 4 hours to 15 minutes

Timeline: 3 weeks from kickoff to production.

The best part? They didn't need to hire anyone new.

This is what practical AI looks like.

```

### Sample 3: Personal Story
```
When I started IntelliAgent, I made every mistake in the book.

The biggest one?

I was so focused on the tech that I forgot to listen to what businesses actually needed.

I'd build beautiful automations... that nobody used.

I'd explain technical concepts... that made clients' eyes glaze over.

I'd propose ambitious projects... that never left the pilot phase.

The turning point came when a client said:

"I don't care how it works. I care that it saves me time."

That changed everything.

Now, every project starts with one question:

"What's the time or money impact?"

If we can't quantify it, we don't build it.

Simple shift. Massive difference.
